# 🍫 Hershey Product Space Optimization  
### CMU MISM BIDA Capstone • Enterprise Data Science

This repository contains the final presentation and summary for my **capstone project with The Hershey Company**, completed as part of Carnegie Mellon University’s **Master of Information Systems Management (BIDA)** program.

Due to confidentiality, code and data cannot be published — this repo provides a high-level overview and the final presentation.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Hershey wanted a data-driven system to determine the **optimal shelf-space allocation** for different product usage occasions across **6,000+ retail stores**.

Our team built a **prescriptive analytics model** combining:
- Regression modeling  
- Multi-objective optimization  
- Store-level demographic and sales features  
- Shelf-type specific allocation rules  

---

## 🎯 What We Built  
- A regression framework to estimate sales impact based on shelf allocation  
- A linear optimization engine recommending % space per product occasion  
- A unified data pipeline merging planograms, sales, and product attributes  
- Clear, interpretable recommendations for merchandising teams  

---

## 📈 Impact  
- **17% improvement in sales** on average  
- Up to **24% lift** on small shelves  
- Estimated **~$5M annual revenue increase** across the retailer network  

---

## 🧠 Methods Used  
- Random Forest & Ridge Regression  
- Linear optimization  
- Demographic feature analysis  
- Shelf-type level scoring  
- Prescriptive recommendations
